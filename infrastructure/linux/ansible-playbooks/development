# --- All-in-one ---

# Each host on all-in-one group includes NGINX as ingress, Docker Compose for
# running workloads, and PostgreSQL as DBMS. To include also MySQL DBMS on a
# host, add the same host also to the mysql group.

# --- Distributed ---

# Ingress, worker, postgresql, and mysql groups are meant for distributing
# different components of infrastucture to separate hosts. If you want to use
# them, you should ensure secure communication between hosts. For example,
# use a virtual private network and/or use SSL/TLS connections in all
# communication between hosts.
